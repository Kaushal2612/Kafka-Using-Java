Your Apache Kafka is now Up and Running !! ðŸ˜Š
  
Now, Clone the Project and Open both HelloProducer and HelloConsumer in different Intellij/Eclipse IDE.
  - perform maven build from terminal: **mvn spring-boot:run** for HelloProducer Application, 
  - perform maven build from terminal: **mvn spring-boot:run** for HelloConsumer Application

Now send the POST request with the following details:
 - Request Url: localhost:8080/kafka/producer
 - Request Body: {"name":"Apache Kafka", "message":"This is the message"}

You can also test the message written by producer on the topic by executing below command in your kafka folder. Open Command Line and execute: 
 - **.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat -bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 -topic 'topic name'(without quote) -group first_app**
Now, send the message on the topic, you will find the output as shown below:
